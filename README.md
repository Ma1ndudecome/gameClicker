<h2>🛠️ Key Features</h2>
<h3>📂 Preservation of Data</h3>
<p>We utilized <code>localStorage</code> to maintain crucial game data across sessions. This ensures a seamless experience even when the page is reloaded or navigated away. Here’s what is preserved:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Health Points (HP) of the Main Character</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Healing Potions in the Inventory</strong> (persistent across pages)</li>
    <li><strong>Enemy Status</strong> (e.g., Alive/Dead). If the boss or any enemy dies, their status remains consistent even after reloading the page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🎮 Game Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Health Points (HP) Management</strong> for both the Main Character and Enemies</li>
    <li><strong>Healing the Main Character</strong> during battles</li>
    <li><strong>Collecting Potions</strong> and adding them to the inventory</li>
    <li><strong>Spawning New Enemies</strong> after defeating one</li>
    <li><strong>Attacking Enemies</strong> with strategic timing</li>
</ul>

<h3>⌨️ Key Bindings</h3>
